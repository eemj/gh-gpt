# gh-gpt

This is a simple tool to use the GitHub Copilot API as a GPT API.

## Ensure you have a GitHub Copilot API key

The `~/.config/github-copilot/hosts.json` file is created when you log in to Copilot in an editor (VS Code, IDEA, etc.).

## Usage

```bash
gh-gpt run "Who are you?"
# I am an artificial intelligence designed to assist with information and tasks. How can I help you today?
```
